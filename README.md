What is keylogger?

A keylogger is a type of software or hardware that secretly records everything you type on your keyboard. It can capture passwords, messages, and any other information you input. This data is then sent to someone else without your knowledge.

Examples :
1. Imagine you're using a public computer at a library. If a keylogger is installed on that computer, it could record your username and password when you log into your email. The person who installed the keylogger could then access your email account using that information.
2. Imagine you're at a friend's house and use their computer to log into your Instagram account. If a keylogger is secretly installed on that computer, it will record everything you type, including your Instagram username and password. Later, the person who installed the keylogger could use that recorded information to access your Instagram account without your knowledge. They could view your messages, post on your behalf, or even change your account settings.
